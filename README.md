# Express-Digi

This is a simple repository created for testing purposes. It contains the first basic Express.js server I built.

## About

- Built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).
- A minimal setup to understand how an Express server works.
- Serves as a foundation for future Express-based projects.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishipandey2/Express-Digi.git
   cd Express-Digi
